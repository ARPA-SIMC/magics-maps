# Regional shapefile for Italy

Since Magics 2.24 the state/province shapefile included uses province
boundaries for Italy instead of regional boundaries.

To restore regional boundaries the original files should be overwritten
with the files in this directory (taken from Magics version 2.22).

The files are tipically installed in: `/usr/share/magics/10m/`
